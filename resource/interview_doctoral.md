## Technical Interview in DENOS Lab 

If you are shortlisted for a technical interview for our doctoral positions, we will email you in Dec or Jan for details (for Fall candidates). The interview is typically 1 hour in length and has several components. 
* [10 minutes] A brief **introduction** of yourself, your background, research interest, and your career goals. 
* [40 minutes] A technical **presentation** of a research paper. 
  You may or may not be familiar with the topic, 
  and the topic may not be directly related to your research if you join our group. 
  We use the same paper to calibrate all our candidates. 
  The paper assigned to you can be very technical, 
  and we do not expect you to get all the details perfectly. 
  Here are a couple of guidelines  
  - _Problem setting_: Understand the problem setting and the main contribution. No need to fully understand the significance of the paper, but please follow the logic of the paper to have a basic concept of the proposed method and its reasoning.
  - _Algorithm_: Study the algorithm proposed in the paper. Think about how to implement it and the reasons why every step is done.
  - _Empirical study_: Understand how the experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
  - _Theoretical analysis_. At your best effort, understand the details of the analysis.
  - _Your criticism_. What do you think are the weaknesses of the paper, and how do you think they can further improve?
  Note that it is perfectly fine if you cannot understand every detail. Do not lose yourself in some hard theorems, especially when you lack basic knowledge. But we still expect that you can try to find out the background knowledge and pick them up as much as possible.
* [10 minutes] Answer your **questions** about the US, MSU, and DENOS Lab.
