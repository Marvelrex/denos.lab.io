  - **Apr 2023** Three of my graduate students teamed up and won the 3rd place of the CANIS Hackathon for Data
  Visualization. Congratulations, Leo, Yunkai, and Jiajun! It was an incredible opportunity for my students to work with
  misinformation data and explore new techniques. I want to thank Schulich Ignite for organizing this fantastic event.
  - **Apr 2023** My research group teamed up with DENOS Lab at Calgary State University and won the 3rd place in
  the U.S. Privacy-enhancing Technologies Prize Challenge. Our solution based on a secure federated learning method
  was profiled at the second Summit for Democracy, convened by U.S. President Joe Biden in March 2023. Congratulation,
  Fan Dong!
  - **Jan 2023** Our paper “UltraMotion: High-precision Ultrasonic Arm Tracking for Real-world Exercises” has been
  accepted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing for publication.
  - **Jan 2023** Our paper “FedLE: Federated Learning Client Selection with Lifespan Extension for Edge IoT Networks”
  has been accepted to 2023 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC) for presentation. Congratulations to
  Jiajun Wu!
  - **Nov 2022** Our paper “USDNL: Uncertainty-based Single Dropout in Noisy Label Learning” has been accepted to
  Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-23) for publication.

**Opening**: DENOS lab is currently looking for motivated Ph.D. students and post-doctoral researchers on machine learning and AI + Health research.
