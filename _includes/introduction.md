At the Intelligent Data Analytics (<font color="#173d74"><b>ILLIDAN</b></font>) Lab @ [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), we are at the forefront of advancing data science and AI to tackle some of the most critical real-world challenges, commonly known as <font color="#173d74"><b>AI+X</b></font>, with a special emphasis on health informatics. Our research is anchored in the vision of <font color="#173d74"><b>Unified Knowledge Integration</b></font> - an innovative approach that harnesses AI to unify insights from large-scale, noisy, multimodal, and heterogeneous datasets. By seamlessly integrating <em>domain knowledge</em> with novel machine learning and generative AI techniques, we aim to transform various real-world domains, enhance decision making for data science through establishing the closed-loop flow of informatics among key components of <em>human</em>, <em>data</em>, and <em>analytics</em>. In the domain of health informatics, we develop novel tools and systems for improving the understanding, diagnosis, and intervention of diseases, especially Alzheimerâ€™s.
