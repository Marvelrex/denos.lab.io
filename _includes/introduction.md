[//]: # (At the Intelligent Data Analytics &#40;<font color="#173d74"><b>DENOS</b></font>&#41; Lab @ [University of Calgary]&#40;https://umich.edu/&#41;, we are at the forefront of advancing data science and AI to tackle some of the most critical real-world challenges, commonly known as <font color="#173d74"><b>AI+X</b></font>, with a special emphasis on health informatics. Our research is anchored in the vision of <font color="#173d74"><b>Unified Knowledge Integration</b></font> - an innovative approach that harnesses AI to unify insights from large-scale, noisy, multimodal, and heterogeneous datasets. By seamlessly integrating <em>domain knowledge</em> with novel machine learning and generative AI techniques, we aim to transform various real-world domains, enhance decision making for data science through establishing the closed-loop flow of informatics among key components of <em>human</em>, <em>data</em>, and <em>analytics</em>. In the domain of health informatics, we develop novel tools and systems for improving the understanding, diagnosis, and intervention of diseases, especially Alzheimer’s.)
## DENOS Lab @ University of Calgary

**DENOS Lab** stands for **Department of Electrical and Software Engineering**, University of Calgary.  

The **Distributed Edge LearNing and Orchestration Systems (DENOS)** Lab was founded in 2021 by **Dr. Steve Drew**. Our research focuses on building intelligent, sustainable, and privacy-preserving systems that advance distributed and federated learning across cloud–edge infrastructures.

### Research Priorities

#### 1. Federated Learning for Edge Service Orchestration
With **federated learning (FL)** systems gaining wider adoption for privacy-preserving machine learning in heterogeneous infrastructures, performance degradation and longer convergence times are common, leading to **excessive energy consumption** in both cloud resources and battery-powered edge IoT devices.  
We explore how carefully designed FL methods can **guide cloud–edge service orchestration** to tackle these challenges. Our vision is to develop **resilient, sustainable, and privacy-preserving distributed learning methods** for large-scale, real-world deployment.  

We focus on three novel components:
- **Dynamic FL client budgeting** based on node availability and carbon footprints  
- **Task replication algorithms** that minimize privacy impact while improving robustness  
- **Prototype orchestration schedulers** for evaluating our methods in real cloud–edge environments  

#### 2. Federated Learning for Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
**Federated learning** enables collaborative model training on sensitive **electronic health record (EHR)** data while preserving patient privacy and ensuring compliance with **HIPAA** and similar regulations.  
Our goal is to develop new methods and prototypes to address key challenges in EHR-based FL:
- Handling **missing and incomplete data**  
- Enhancing **interoperability** across medical systems  
- Ensuring **fairness** and **robustness** in model performance
